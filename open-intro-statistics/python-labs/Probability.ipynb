    "# Probability\n",
    "# Hot Hands\n",
    "Basketball players who make several baskets in succession are described as having a hot hand. Fans and players have long believed in the hot hand phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that each shot is independent of the next. However, a 1985 paper by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky collected evidence that contradicted this belief and showed that successive shots are independent events (http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/7782/readings/gilovich%20vallone%20tversky.pdf). This paper started a great controversy that continues to this day, as you can see by Googling hot hand basketball.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not expect to resolve this controversy today. However, in this lab we’ll apply one approach to answering questions like this. The goals for this lab are to (1) think about the effects of independent and dependent events, (2) learn how to simulate shooting streaks in R, and (3) to compare a simulation to actual data in order to determine if the hot hand phenomenon appears to be real.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "Our investigation will focus on the performance of one player: Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. His performance against the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA finals earned him the title Most Valuable Player and many spectators commented on how he appeared to show a hot hand. Let’s load some data from those games and look at the first several rows."

    "We’ve shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they long enough to support the belief that he had hot hands? What can we compare them to?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, let’s return to the idea of _independence_. Two processes are independent if the outcome of one process doesn’t effect the outcome of the second. If each shot that a player takes is an independent process, having made or missed your first shot will not affect the probability that you will make or miss your second shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are _not_ independent of one another. Specifically, if the shooter makes his first shot, the hot hand model says he will have a _higher_ probability of making his second shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe. During his career, the percentage of time Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his shooting percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If he makes the first shot and has a hot hand (_not_ independent shots), then the probability that he makes his second shot would go up to, let’s say, 60%,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{shot 2 = H} \\, | \\, \\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.60$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these increased probabilites, you’d expect Kobe to have longer streaks. Compare this to the skeptical perspective where Kobe does _not_ have a hot hand, where each shot is independent of the next. If he hit his first shot, the probability that he makes the second is still 0.45.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{shot 2 = H} \\, | \\, \\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, making the first shot did nothing to effect the probability that he’d make his second shot. If Kobe’s shots are independent, then he’d have the same probability of hitting every shot regardless of his past shots: 45%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve phrased the situation in terms of independent shots, let’s return to the question: how do we tell if Kobe’s shooting streaks are long enough to indicate that he has hot hands? We can compare his streak lengths to someone without hot hands: an independent shooter."

    "While we don’t have any data from a shooter we know to have independent shots, that sort of data is very easy to simulate in R.

As a simple example, you can simulate flipping a fair coin with the following."
